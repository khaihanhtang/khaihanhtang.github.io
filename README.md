My name is Khai Hanh Tang. I am currently a research fellow in Cryptography at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (from December 2022 till now).

My PhD candidature is from January 2018 till July 2022 at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, with the thesis title _**New and Improved Zero-Knowledge Argument Systems for Code-Based Cryptography**_.  

My research interests include zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs, code-based ZKP, ...) and privacy-preserving signatures.

Countries I have ever been to are 🇻🇳 🇹🇭 🇵🇭 🇸🇬 🇲🇾 🇯🇵 🇮🇩 🇦🇺 🇫🇷 🇮🇹 🇻🇦 🇩🇪 🇧🇭 (transit).
